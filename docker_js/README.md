# Basic Express App

This is a minimal Express application that exposes a single route `/` which returns JSON { message: 'success' }.

Run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ or run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "message": "success" }
```
